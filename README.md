# 👋 Hi!
Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I showcase my shitty ass code. I'm Joel, an Italian high school student from the Galileo Galilei Institute, majoring in Computer Science.

## 📚 About Me

- **Name:** Joel Stephan.
- **Age:** 18 
- **School:** Galileo Galilei Institute.
- **Major:** Computer Science.
- **Languages:** C, Java, C#, and a sprinkle of MySQL (the secret ingredient is pain).
  
## 🦸‍♂️ Fun Facts

- I can find diamonds in minecraft very quicly (Like seriously, someone hire me already)
- I don't remember shit.
- Idk, js sucks?.

Feel free to stalk my repositories. Star them, fork them, or just look at them and wonder what the fuck I was thinking when I wrote some of that code. I'm sure you'll find plenty of material to wonder about my sanity.
