# 👋 Hi!
Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I showcase my shitty ass code and questionable life choices. I'm Joel, an 18-year-old Italian high school student from the Galileo Galilei Institute, majoring in Computer Science.

## 📚 About Me

- **Name:** Joel Stephan.
- **Age:** 18 
- **School:** Galileo Galilei Institute.
- **Major:** Computer Science.
- **Languages:** C, Java, C#, and a sprinkle of MySQL (the secret ingredient is pain).

## 🖥️ My Journey

I started with C and Java, because what's the point of living if you're not constantly questioning your life choices. Now, I'm dipping my toes into C# and MySQL. Yes, I'm aware of how exciting that sounds.

## 🎯 Future Aspirations

Cybersecurity is on my radar. But, honestly, who knows? I might end up killing my self first. For now, I'm just doing what I love, which is mostly consists of staring at my screen and wondering why it's not compiling.

## 🛠️ Skills

- **C:** Crashing and memory leaking harder than my will to live.
- **Java:** Wondering where the fuck is NullPointerException coming from.
- **C#:** I don't know, C# stuff. (I'm actually liking it so far)
- **MySQL:** Trying to remember if I used SELECT * or SELECT column1, column2 in my last query .

## 🦸‍♂️ Fun Facts

- I can find diamonds in minecraft very quicly (Like seriously, someone hire me already)
- I don't remember shit.
- Idk, js sucks?.

Feel free to stalk my repositories. Star them, fork them, or just look at them and wonder what the fuck I was thinking when I wrote some of that code. I'm sure you'll find plenty of material to wonder about my sanity.
